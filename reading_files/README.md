# reading_files
This assignment contains three additional files and folders: 
(1) x_positions_used_in_lecture.txt
(2) my_data
(3) class_data

(1) is a list of decimal values between 0 and 1. Each value was shown to students for approximately 10 seconds on a graph with only two labels: 0 and 1. From this image, students were told to guess the precise value shown on the graph. The list in (1) contains the true values.
(2) is a list of my guesses for each value.
(3) is a folder with one .txt file for each student in the class. Each file is a list of one student's guesses for each value. It contains (2).
